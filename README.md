# covid19shiny

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of covid19shiny is to provide users with a shinydashboard
created by using `shiny` and `shinydashboard` package, presenting the
state of COVID-19 in the world, which is enhanced with user
interactions. There are also some functions inside the package. The
shiny application could be launched by using `launch_app()` function
inside the package. This shinydashboard would allow users to gain
insights of COVID-19 state in the world.

List of data inside the package:  
\- **covid19wrangled** is the wrangled version of the data taken from
`download_merged_data` from
[tidycovid19](https://github.com/joachim-gassen/tidycovid19) package  
\- **covid19total** presents the summary of COVID-19 cases per country,
showing total confirmed cases, total deaths and total recovered cases of
a country alongside with other information  
\- **worldshp** is a world shape file needed to create a map

List of functions inside the package:  
\- **launch\_app** would launch the shiny application showing the state
of COVID-19 in the world  
\- **selectInput01** would produce the selectInput from `shiny`
according to the inputs provided  
\- **dailyplot** would create a line graph showing either the daily
confirmed cases, daily death, or daily recovered according to the inputs
specified. The input `variable_name` would change the y-axis of the line
graph to represent the variable  
\- **covidtable** would produce a table by using the `DT` package, which
is based on the specified dataset

More information on the package can be found on the [pkgdown
website](...).

## Installation

You can install the development version of `covid19shiny` package with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("etc5523-2020/r-package-assessment-helenevangelinaa")
```

## Launching the app

This is a basic example on how to launch the shiny dashboard:

``` r
library(covid19shiny)
launch_app()
```

## Usage

The functions inside the package were made to simplify the R codes to
create the shiny application, as well as to make it easier for users to
produce the plot and table desired.

Here is an example of how to use the package to generate the dataset:

``` r
kable(covid19total)
```

Here is a sample line graph shown in the shiny app which is generated by
using `dailyplot` function (this function cannot be produced outside the
shinyapp as it is based on the input from selectInput
(e.g. input$country)):

``` r
dailyall <- covid19wrangled %>%
    group_by(date) %>%
    summarise(totalconfirmed = sum(confirmed),
              totaldeaths = sum(deaths),
              totalrecovered = sum(recovered)) %>%
    mutate(confirmed_lag = lag(totalconfirmed),
           daily_confirmed = totalconfirmed - confirmed_lag,
           death_lag = lag(totaldeaths),
           daily_death = totaldeaths - death_lag,
           recovered_lag = lag(totalrecovered),
           daily_recovered = totalrecovered - recovered_lag)
  
  plot_all <- dailyall %>%
    ggplot(aes_string(x = "date",
               y= "daily_confirmed")) +
    geom_col(fill = "#F09366") +
    geom_line(size = 0, alpha = 0) +
    geom_smooth(color = "red", size = 1) +
    labs(x = "Date",
         y = "Daily number of confirmed cases",
         title = "Figure: Trend of Daily Number of confirmed cases") +
    theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "grey16"),
          plot.background = element_rect(fill = "grey16"),
          panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
          panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
          plot.title = element_text(size = 12), 
          plot.title.position = "plot",
          text = element_text(color = "white"),
          axis.text = element_text(color = "white"),
          axis.line.x = element_line(color = "white",
                                     size = 0.6),
          axis.line.y = element_line(color = "white",
                                     size = 0.6))
  
plot_all
```

Here is an example of how to use the `covidtable` function, which would
result to a table shown below:

``` r
covidtable(covid19total)
```
